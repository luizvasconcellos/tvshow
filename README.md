# tvshow

App developped based on the public TVMaze API (https://www.tvmaze.com/api). 
The App was developed using Xcode 13.1 and Swift 5, based on MVVM Architecture, I used cocoa pods as a Dependency Manager and RXSwift, Swinject, Kingfisher and Alamofire pods.

This app will can in iPhone simulator or phisical devices with iOS Version 15 and above.

When you run this app it will show you a blank screen with a field to search shows and 3 tab bar items, the first one (selected on start) is for search shows, the 2nd it will show the TV Shows you selected as favorite and the 3rd tab is for search for persons.

Enjoy the your tv shows, search for a show, select it as favorite, you can see the show and episode details. If you are searching for an specific person go to the person tab and search for this person, go ahead and you can see the shows he/she participated and you can see the show details too.
